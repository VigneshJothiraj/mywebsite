# Data-Driven Decision Making: My Go-To Frameworks for PM Prioritization

Product managers are spoiled for choice when it comes to prioritization models. This post distills what actually works in practice and when to use which tool.

## Using the Matrix

The impact vs effort matrix is a fast, visual way to align teams on what to ship next. Plot ideas by expected value (impact) and required investment (effort), then focus on high-impact, low-effort bets first.

### How to read it

- Quick Wins: high impact, low effort — do these immediately.
- Strategic Bets: high impact, high effort — plan and sequence.
- Low-Hanging Fruit: low impact, low effort — do if they unblock or de-risk.
- Avoid: low impact, high effort — challenge the premise.

## When to choose RICE vs ICE

RICE adds structure where inputs are uncertain across reach, impact, confidence, and effort. Use ICE when you need speed with lightweight inputs. Use RICE when decisions will face scrutiny or require cross-functional alignment.

## Execution notes

Whichever you pick, keep assumptions explicit, quantify where possible, and revisit scores as new data arrives.
