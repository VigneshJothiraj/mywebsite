# Hey! So Glad You're Here. 

**Builder. Breaker. Product Thinker.**

I’m **Vignesh Jothiraj** — a Security Product Manager who started out
writing code, broke things as a Security Engineer, and now builds
secure, scalable platforms that people love to use.

With over **7+ years** of experience spanning software development,
security engineering, and product leadership, I’ve worked at the
intersection of developer experience, enterprise security, and platform
tooling — helping large organizations move fast without breaking things.

I believe great products aren’t just functional — they’re secure,
intuitive, and deeply aligned with the people who use them. My edge? A
hands-on background in security and engineering that helps me spot what
others might miss.

I didn’t take the MBA route. I built my way here — solving real
problems, launching real products, and learning the hard stuff by doing.

This space is a glimpse into that journey — one where every decision,
every trade-off, and every feature has a story.
